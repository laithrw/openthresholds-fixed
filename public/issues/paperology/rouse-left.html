<h3 class="popout">What could the “activity” component of the “research and activity group” look like?</h3>
<p>From the earliest meetings of the Paperology Research and Activity Group (Paperology RAG) in the Fall of 2020, the organizers put forward the following questions: What kind of work could we do together, beyond reading, discussion, and demonstration? What could the “activity” component of the “research and activity group” look like? These questions sparked my imagination in terms of thinking about the difficulty of documentation. We had Zoom chat logs, posts from a Google classroom website, PDFs of readings, and our own notes, but these various forms failed to capture the feeling of being a part of the Paperology RAG. We had files, but could we make an experiential file, one that would be handmade, and both personal but also collaborative?</p>
<p>I began to think about designing a collaborative activity that would leverage the texture of our connection, including the texture of paper, which was our shared object of inquiry. The idea of a collaborative book project occurred to me. We could mail this collaboratively-made book around the world to each other, and contribute to its growth over time. As a Games scholar, the notion of a playful form of documentation that was focused not on completeness or fidelity but rather affective experience appealed to me. I hoped this playful spirit would be inviting to others, as well. I decided to create a blank book that was not quite blank in the traditional sense. I wanted to use interactive paper forms in such a way that they could invite the playful creativity of others.</p>
<p>These images show several pages of design sketching from my notebook about how to make a book for the Paperology group to co-create in and with. Some of my initial ideas were overly deterministic, such as the thought to create one page per month of the year. Other ideas had sticking power, such as the though to include different types of paper in some way.</p>

<p>A guiding principle for me in developing the design was to think about the object as an <em>invitation</em> to others, similar to the way in which a toy invites play. I wanted to create a book object that would so delight the beholder that they would be easily inspired to join in and co-create, regardless of prior book-making or paper arts experience. This thinking led me to the idea of the enclosure and the envelope form, and the pleasures of giving and receiving paper mail. I thought about a long set of accordion fold pages, with a little envelope affixed to each page, each with its own enclosure of some kind. </p>
<p>I then considered theming each page in the large accordion fold, an idea I later threw out as overly deterministic again. Instead, I thought about including some additional structures affixed to the inside of the cover, including a large, fold-out map that would be blank. I was hoping this blank map might be an invitation to someone to map the community, map the scholarship, map the concepts we moved through together, or even map the trajectory of the <em>Paperology: An Ephemeral Portrait</em> book itself as it moved through various global postal systems. </p>
<p>As I got to work at my craft table, my ideas began to develop and change right away, by working with my hands and the actual book-making materials. For example, working with the chip boards for making the cover of the book, I chose a horizontal orientation for the book instead of a vertical one as I had originally sketched. This horizontal orientation felt more inviting in the hand somehow, and was also broader and more expansive, allowing the central accordion-fold pages to expand to an even wider length. I also came up with the idea to add two miniature books in addition to the map as extra structures affixed inside the back cover, as well as multiple enclosures throughout the pages. I kept thinking about how I could maximise the surfaces of “invitation” to others. </p>
<p>In terms of the envelopes affixed to the accordion pages, these were handmade and each held a sample of a different kind of paper: brown Kraft paper, deli paper, different weights of art papers, handmade papers, a sample of Swedish wallpaper, a strip of multi-coloured flocked velour papers, and even a polypropylene paper known as <em>yupo</em> paper, which we might debate about being paper at all! See figures X - XX for images of the completed substrate or “blank” version of the book.</p>

<p>My last step was to inscribe the book with the following dedication:</p>
<blockquote>
To My Fellow Paperologists: <br/>
Thank you for extending fibres of connection in such a fraught time. I hope you will bring that same spirit of generous & generative creativity to this material text. <br>
-Skövde, Sweden, December 2020
</blockquote>

<p>I then shared the book in a video at our December 2020 research group meeting (the video can be accessed here: Add URL). The group was very receptive, with many signing up to receive the book and contribute right away. One group member even typed into the chat that day after watching the video: “My desire to touch this object is almost overwhelming.” This response felt very encouraging to me, as I hoped it indicated a strong will to participate from many in the group. After Christmas, I packed up the book in layers of bubble wrap and an archival box, and set that inside a reused Amazon box (the cardboard calling card of the pandemic), and I shipped the book out to its first stop in Vienna, Austria. </p>

<p>As the project developed and more and more community members contributed their creative work, at many paper-based historical traditions have emerged as key precedents to our book: the commonplace book; the scrapbook; the encyclopaedia; the card catalogue; and correspondence art or mail art. Next I briefly discuss the history and significance of these forms, and how the <em>Paperology: An Ephemeral Portrait</em> book resonates with these traditions. </p>

<p>The history of the commonplace book began as a metaphorical “place” and method of storing and organising information, and was conceived of in the classical period, as written about by Aristotle and Cicero (CITE). Their theoretical book concept did not take actual, material book form until later in the medieval and early modern periods. This later materialised commonplace book was a place to copy down, place in relation, and variously organise extracts from works by others, to be used later in constructing your own argument or book. The commonplace book was often created well before the draft phase or even the concept phase of a later book project (CITE). It was created as a space of early germination. As so the form was not focused on product (the eventual manuscript) but rather on process; a slow process which we might understand as a kind of pre-citation methodology. </p>
