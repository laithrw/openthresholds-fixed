<p>Photographs that dredge up memories of events from my past immediately coincide with a song by The Cure called “Pictures of You.” The lyrics replay in my head as I go about my days.</p>

<p>Beautiful and sad. Love and loss is life. During the Covid 19 lockdown, I revisited my past often &mdash; in photographs &mdash; still images in motion fixed onto the paper &mdash; are the only clear visual reminders of the greatest love I ever had. The others I've forgotten or gotten over, but this particular love stole my heart forever. He was a chestnut-colored Icelandic horse named Juli fra Gimli: 750 pounds, and 13 hands high. His previous owners cast him aside. They said he was troublesome, not cooperative and no one wanted him but me.</p>

<p>Within the Paperology Book, I created a small pamphlet of black and white photographs of me and Juli. The photographs were taken by my ex-husband around 2008-2009. During our early days of Paperology, I was teaching myself how to bind books. The pamphlet stitch is the simplest form of stitching sheets of paper together. So, when I received the Paperology book and it was my turn to create/contribute, I capitalized on the fact that there was real estate to do a mini album inside the book.</p>

<p>The photographs represent one of the most impactful periods in my life when I lived on 60 acres of land in the Adirondack Mountains, and when I acquired Juli. Our bond was (in my memory) unlike any I’ve ever created with another being. Having such a trusting relationship with a large, powerful animal is a gift, not to be taken for granted. We danced throughout life for a while, adapting, learning, getting our footing, communicating through physical space and proximity, and teaching each other respect, confidence, acceptance, and understanding. We were in tune. All I had to do was look him in the eyes, tilt my head to the left and he would walk to the right. If I stood at his side and tapped his chest, he would lower his head to the ground. We never crowded each other. I had a healthy fear of him, he had a healthy fear of me.</p>

<p>With Lokta paper, waxed linen thread, photographic paper, photograph corners, and ink, my memories, and this love were allowed to travel the globe.</p>
