<h3 class="popout">This peepbox is an opportunity to reframe, refamiliarize, and revalue something that has become <span class="texthighlight">invisible in its ubiquity</span> &mdash; paper.</h3>
<p>I have been working with paper media for several years and some past artworks have explored thaumatropes (paper disks with images on each side that blur together when spun), and paper engineering including pop-up work and paper folding and cutting. More broadly my artwork explores histories of visual and communications technologies and I am particularly drawn to these histories because they allow me to take an alternative, anachronistic route to rethink contemporary technologies and digital cultures.</p>
<p>I was thinking about virtual imagery and current virtual reality technologies, and had started to think about peep boxes as part of a pre-history of VR tech. After all, peep boxes produce a powerful 3D depth effect that feels immersive through the act of peeping, foreshadowing the experience of VR. Peep boxes have a long and rich history: they have taken many forms and been constructed in many materials, but I was most interested in the <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/paper-peepshows" target="_blank">paper versions that emerged in the nineteenth century</a>. These paper peep boxes were often sold as souvenirs at large events like world’s fairs, and as paper artifacts they were ephemeral. But they also appeared pasted into children’s books, allowing readers to pull each peep box out from its securing page to enjoy a 3D view at particular moments of the story.</p>
<p>Whereas the box I contributed to the Paperology book functions mostly as a historical peep box would have, my choice to include it isn’t really about nostalgically and faithfully reconstructing old technology. This peep box, just like <a href="https://www.tinacorfield.com/transcontinental-viewsofwaywardconduct" target="_blank">many of the paper peep boxes I have constructed</a>, is much more about creating an opportunity, through an accessible and craftable model, to reframe, refamiliarize, and revalue something that has become invisible in its ubiquity—paper.</p>
<p>Paper remains an important and ever-present material even in the digital era, so my choice of paper as a medium is important. I adopt paper to point toward a history of paper media that has always existed alongside other more technological media. I use paper also as a powerful signifier, one that represents the non-digital and one that introduces a very different mode of feeling, thinking, and doing my work compared to when I work with digital technologies.</p>
