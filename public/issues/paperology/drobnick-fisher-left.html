<p>Greeting cards occupy an odd place in the cultural use of paper: mass-produced but used to convey personal emotions; signifiers of fondness and thoughtfulness but often thrown away after a short time; anonymously composed but signed by the sender as if choosing was the same as authorship. These readymade packages of feeling connect people in a ritualistic way during holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, and many other events.</p>

<p>The ubiquitous presence of greeting cards is hard to avoid. Such cards may seem obsolete in the age of email and social media. Yet stores devote sizable aisle space to cards for a ever-proliferating array of occasions. Boutiques feature artisanal cards produced in limited editions. A secondary market of auctioneers and retailers conduct a brisk trade in cards as historical and collectible ephemera. The consequence? Physical cards in the digital age have become even more loaded with specialness and purpose.</p>

<p>Over the years, we would make personalized cards for special occasions for family and friends. These typically involved cut-ups of magazine imagery collaged over whatever extra greeting card was on hand. Cartoon balloons would spout topical, satirical commentary, counter-messages, and family in-jokes. The cards' method aligned with aspects of Situationist détournement, Surrealist exquisite corpses, Fluxus humor and the quirky expressiveness of mail art—all meant to cause a fun, momentary disruption of the receiver's (mostly) suburban locale and sensibility. When we were too busy, however, there was always the default option to purchase a card, as some kind of card was better than none.</p>

<p>Greeting cards are bearers of affect, given with love, seriousness, authenticity, but what should one do with them after being received and read? Many people are reluctant to throw them out—such an act feels disrespectful, as if the sender's sentiments were also being discarded. The situation of holding on to cards has recently surfaced for us as one of our parents has sold her home, which is filled with decades of accumulated photographs, albums and greeting cards. Boxes upon boxes were squirrelled away in closets and drawers, with cards from both joyous and sad occasions, birthdays and funerals, bearing cute grandkids' drawings and inspirational messages. The question of how to dispose of these materials keeps being postponed as none of the siblings want to distress an aging parent.</p>

<p>Even in our own home, unused greeting cards have piled up. They may serve as materials for future projects, or they may just be obsolete and unusable, such as a card for a mother's 80th birthday (which occurred 14 years ago). For the Paperology book, we decided to consider these excess cards as raw materials to appropriate and subvert. Rather than making a collage, we sought to heighten the short-lived purpose of the greeting card by turning it into another transitory paper item—confetti. Dismantling several cards by hand with a hole-punch, we meticulously saved the rounded bits. In the Paperology book, there is an invitation to open the envelopes, pinch some of the confetti, fling it into the air, and kindle an instant celebration: one that may be real or imagined. The ritualistic gesture of sending a greeting card shifts into a momentary, performative act, perhaps even a blessing.</p>

<p>Despite the destruction implicit in reducing the cards to unrecognizable specks, the process of repurposing the cards embodied a particular kind of joy: hinting at a critique of the greeting card industry, conveying an abstract message of festivity. Instead of languishing in a drawer, these cards now carry the potential for liveliness. Ironically, <em>Kindly Deliver To...</em>'s meditation on ephemerality is contained in an object, the Paperology book, that will no doubt be housed eventually in an archive or a library's permanent collection. Yet the potential for conferring joy is one of the simple pleasures of paper—no matter where it may reside.</p>
