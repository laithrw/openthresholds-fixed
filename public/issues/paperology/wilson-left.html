<p>The lines written (or scrunched in paper) on this page are taken from a poem, <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A13415.0001.001/1:61.4?rgn=div2;view=fulltext" target="_blank"><em>The Praise of Hemp-seed</em></a>, written by a man called John Taylor and first printed in 1620.</p>

<p>The poem reflects on the material process of paper-making – including its prior life as plant-matter, especially hemp, and as ropes and clothing – but the poem is most interested in the ways that paper asks us to think differently about time, agency, and creative collaborations or clashes. What do we do with a pious text printed on sheets that were once ‘sweaty socks’? Are records of early global voyages altered by their substrate’s earlier travels round the world as ship sails? And would the works of Chaucer, Gower, and Shakespeare survive (Taylor’s male literary canon is close to the most conservative version of our own) were it not for paper’s capacity to capture ideas that sprang fourth half a millennia ago and preserve them for us today?</p>

<p>These are examples of the ‘phylosophy’ that Taylor’s papery poem conjures up. In taking us first through the process of paper making (albeit a rough, idealised one) and then asking us to dwell on paper’s interventions in intellectual life, *The Praise of Hempseed* harnesses something of paper’s dual existence as both a tangible, physical object and a material to think with, or think through. <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/899725" target="_blank">In my written academic work</a> I’m interested in this aspect of paper’s doubleness. Normally I use words, typed onto a work document or scribbled in a notebook, to convey something of paper’s generativity in this sense. But my contribution to this project was an attempt to portray with paper itself something of that tension between objects and ideas – to make legible paper in all its unwieldy, physical glory just at the moment when Taylor transports his readers away from the material and up into the blue skies of the philosophical.</p>
<p>Not being an artist my contribution to the Paperology book is aesthetically wobbly, to say the least. I couldn’t get the tissue paper to stay within the lines of the letters, the glue discoloured the pale pink, and my handwriting strays uncertainly across the page despite obvious efforts to the contrary. My conception of what this page might look like remained stubbornly inside my head, while the object I produced bore a conceptual relation rather than a technical likeness to the plan. Paper insists that we think about those gaps between the imagined and the material, as well as the similarities: the moments when ideas and embodied experiences part ways, and the light gets in.</p>
