<h3 class="popout">My contribution comes from the depths of my coat pockets in which <span class="texthighlight">bits of paper</span> mix with sand and lint. </h3>
<p>I continually collect stuff, like tickets, vouchers, and receipts (and paper slips from fortune cookies). When I put away coats and jackets for summer or winter, I dig through my pockets and find pieces of the paper trail of the last months. In an archival collection, these would be categorized as <a href="https://www.google.de/books/edition/Encyclopedia_of_Ephemera/WXl0DwAAQBAJ?hl=de&gbpv=1&dq=encyclopedia+of+ephemera&printsec=frontcover" target="_blank">ephemera</a>. In the jumbled collection of my pockets, they are the residue of everyday interactions and transactions. I never thought or even wondered about the little collection of slips, and only notice when they end up in the washing machine and get stuck in the door seal.</p>

<p>These stubs use thermal paper. It has a slick feel, and all the specimens I (unintentionally) collected are small and oblong. Thermal paper is resistant, but print fades when exposed to heat; it can last up to 25 years; it sometimes still contains small amounts of a toxic chemical, bisphenol A, that rubs off on skin and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-010-3936-9" target="_blank">seeps</a> into bodies; it cannot be <a href="https://www.saskwastereduction.ca/recycle/resources/paper/bpa-receipts" target="_blank">recycled</a> because of the chemicals used in the coating.</p>

<p>It is a complicated object in terms of time frames: Thermal paper lasts longer than we make use of it: tickets and receipts as typical ephemera, are quickly discarded – their social life is short while chemicals leave traces in the environment.</p>
<p>Most thermal paper objects are associated with spaces that we pass through. Travelling on busses and trains, and going through supermarket self-checkouts accumulates thermal paper tickets that have to be scanned at turnstiles and swing gates and are then discarded in overflowing bins. These transient spaces that customers and passengers pass through to go somewhere else. Supermarkets, bus terminals, airports, and parking lots are ‘negative’ spaces that are lacking histories, memories, and relations. Marc Augé, the theorist of late-modern <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/148215381@N02/" target="_blank">non-places</a> <a href="https://books.google.de/books?hl=de&lr=&id=DVycEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT5&dq=auge+non+place&ots=6Dyqf9E7Di&sig=Hel3n28ca5cxRJbR8CtLYhoPOkk&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=auge%20non%20place&f=false" target="_blank">writes</a> that crossing them “the user of a non-place is in contractual relations with it (or with the powers that govern it). He is reminded, when necessary, that the contract exists. One element in this is the way the non-place is to be used: the ticket he has bought, the card he will have to show at the tollbooth, even the trolley he trundles round the supermarket, are all more or less clear signs of it.” Thermal paper stubs are part of the fabric of non-places. But when we take them home, they can turn into something else.</p>
