<p>My papercutting has been inspired by nineteenth-century American Publisher’s bindings, particularly <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/spring-blossoms" target="_blank">the work of Margaret Armstrong</a>. Her designs are always so elegant and organic. They’ve been a challenge to translate from a tooled design into a papercut, but that’s been fun for me. I thought it worked well next to Catriona's page.</p>
