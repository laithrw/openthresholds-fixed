<p>Toy money was central to my childhood. My sister and I were raised to be good consumers. We played “store” and repeatedly diverted our Monopoly money to what we considered more interesting purposes. How much do those games explain about my persisting attachment to those papery scraps, despite the convenience and power of the plastic that’s also in my wallet?</p>

<p>Our parents’ collection of Canadian Tire money &mdash; stuffed into the dashboard of the car and into the kitchen drawer that stored things like old keys and paper clips &mdash; was also useful to our make-believe. It likely confused my sister and me about how to draw the line between toy money, which we had, and real money, which we didn’t. In the second half of the twentieth century, the bills distributed as part of Canadian Tire’s customer loyalty program were printed by the same corporations &mdash; the British American Bank Note Company and then the Canadian Bank Note Company &mdash; that printed Canada’s legal tender.</p>
<p>In my childhood imagination, the smiling face Sandy McTire kept company with the non-smiling face of the Queen.</p>
<p>Sometimes we drew or coloured the money that we used to play store. One misleading lesson from my childhood was that it might be fun to make money.</p>

<p>To make sure that paper money got included in our Paperology paper book, I first downloaded the images of various old banknotes and letters of credit from Wikipedia entries and “notaphily” websites and printed them out on computer paper. I continue to have the most vivid memories of the next step &mdash; which had me remembering and reliving those childhood crafts, as I sat on the floor of my study with my scissors and coloured pencils.</p>
<p>I needed to do some colouring because my images were printed only on one side of the page, whereas paper money (like book paper) is double-sided.</p>
<p>I felt like a counterfeiter.</p>

<p>Despite my efforts at accuracy, you will have to use your powers of make-believe to the utmost to see the Paperology Book’s scraps of paper as real money.  But money as such &mdash; paper currency above all &mdash; always demands the exercise of the imagination. For those bits of paper to pass current as money, for them to be exchangeable with things of more solid, apparent value, people have to imagine in concert that something can made from next to nothing.</p>

<p>I currently make my money as &mdash; improbably enough &mdash; a scholar of the eighteenth century. Paper’s capacity to store and transmit value fascinated eighteenth-century English commentators. Yet they worried about how portable that paper was compared to the metal disks that were the more traditional vehicles for economic value.</p>
<p>In eighteenth-century eyes, this paper was a winged thing. It flew. In 1776 Adam Smith depicted paper money as having “Daedalian wings.” In a 1733 poem on the “Use of Riches,” Alexander Pope wrote of gold as having been “imped” by “Paper Credit” &mdash; borrowing a term from a falconry that named the effort to improve the falcon’s flight.</p>

<p>When I put my banknotes into an envelope (prior to putting the Paperology Book itself into an envelope), I wished to bear witness to that mobility and to revive that crossing of the economic and the ornithological.</p>
