<p>For my contribution, I wanted to focus on two examples of the kinds of paper that newspaper workers used in their daily routines (and in some cases, still do, even if they often write for news sites).</p>

<p>On the left side of the page, you can see story-assignment sheets—these have some basic facts about a story, including estimated word length, expected page placement, run date, and any instructions to a photographer or an artist (if it was being illustrated), and the department (“editorial” if it was in the newsroom). Alternatively, it could be the name for an advertisement and used to help place ads in the paper. In either case, they were used at <em>The San Diego Union</em>, likely in the mid-century last century; my best guess is around the 1950s and 1960s. The paper became <em>The San Diego Union Tribune</em> by the end of the 20th century, and is still published. It <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/about-union-tribune/sdut-history-san-diego-union-tribune-2011nov17-story.html" target="_blank">traces its origins</a> to the mid-1800s.</p>
<p>The section for the “slug” was for a short title for the piece in question—usually the headline or more likely a shortened version of it, sometimes with the reporter’s last name. This term came from the days of hot type—when letters were set by hand and later by Linotype machine. Today, slugs are still used in the file names of content management systems (CMS).</p>

<p>On the right side, I’ve pasted the cover of one of my reporter notebooks—while I’m also a media historian, I still freelance, and these are by far the best pads I’ve used. I used similar pads while a news intern at <em>The Seattle Times</em> and while a journalism student at the University of Washington in the late 2000s.</p>

<p>This particular example was made by <a href="https://portagenotebooks.com/about-us/" target="_blank">Portage</a>, which has been selling notebooks in this style—with few changes—since the mid-1950s, about the same era as the sheets discussed above.</p>
<p>The combination of nostalgia and practicality with paper is common with news workers. Despite the move to a <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262692830/the-myth-of-the-paperless-office/" target="_blank">“paperless” office</a> (which, I’d agree, has never really been achieved), these notebooks are still used by journalists. The story/ad slips were used at my college newspapers through the late 2000s, and I suspect they’re also still in use in small community newspapers. </p>
<p>Paper and news work have an enduring relationship, even in a digital age, perhaps because paper has a similarly enduring quality, and the ability to coexistent with digital tools such as smartphones and tablets. Journalism and paper, in other words, are old friends.</p>
