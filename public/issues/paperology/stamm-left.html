<p>I must admit to having profoundly mixed feelings about my contribution to the Paperology book being digitized. On the one hand, I am elated to see that it will be discoverable and accessible to readers and researchers beyond the scope of the wonderful group of people who participated in making it. In being digitized, it is entering into a new stream of documents in a way that has defined the practice of historical research in recent decades. When I started graduate school in 1999, getting access to something as mainstream as *The New York Times* involved going to the library to look at bound indexes and then pulling microfilm reels to locate and print individual articles. Research in trade journals could mean weeks of time in the library basement moving heavy volumes back and forth from the stacks to a reading table and photocopier. Archival research meant travel to look paper documents. And more photocopies.</p>

<p>Like many historians I have increasingly found that many of the things that I need for my research can be accessed digitally. The work that went into <a href="https://www.pennpress.org/9780812223811/sound-business/" target="_blank">my first book</a> generated nine boxes worth of archival research that sit stacked in the corner of my office. That book was, ironically, mostly about radio. <a href="https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12038/dead-tree-media" target="_blank">My second book</a> was about paper, and it left me with one banker’s box worth of documents, even though there was more archival research in it. In the past three years, I have written about two thirds of another book about paper, and in the process generated maybe one thick file folder of paper documents. Everything else is digital. This a commonplace story.</p>

<p>For all that is more convenient about being a historian in an age of mass digitization, I cannot help but miss those feelings of labor and discovery involved in working with paper. There is still a joy in traveling and then settling into an archive with a cart of boxes of paper documents. In reading them, I determine discoverability, not a machine. I might miss some things that a keyword search would turn up in the digital realm, but I also learn to see patterns in the paper that the machine would not. As a historian, my connection to the paper documents still seems more immediate and personal.</p>

<p>My contribution to the Paperology book was based on some scraps of paper that evoked memories for me, and there was something special about seeing them in Montreal after their long journey. In the bound volume, these documents felt like part of a private conversation among likeminded people that was made public in a very limited way to other likeminded people who had physically assembled at the <a href="https://artefactlab.ca/paperology/symposium/" target="_blank">symposium</a>. Digitized, all of this becomes something else. I’d like to think that someone stumbling across the book online will take the time to engage with it and not just scroll past. I am glad that they might have the opportunity to do that with the digitization. But when I think about this book landing somewhere with a reader, I still picture that being in its paper form. Maybe I’m making too much of the materiality and aura of the thing. Time marches on and we adapt: this present note never existed for me as anything but a digital file.</p>
