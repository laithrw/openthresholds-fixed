<h2 class="popout">Paper gives <span class="texthighlight">tangible shape</span> to my life.</h2>
<p>I work on the turn of the twentieth century, where everything seems to be paper-based: news, advertisements, photographs, early film prints, medical records, correspondence from the Western front to shopping lists love letters wired telegrams, the little curlers you’d put in your hair, dolls and trading cards, the stuff you pasted on walls and notebooks to amuse yourself. Everything was paper.</p>
<p>I live in that world still, the world confined to the archive, so to me everything remains paper. Even in an age defined by digital interactivity and online finding aids, the virtual is construed around the negative space afforded by the presence (or absence) of a paper trail.</p>

<p>My contribution is a modest shrine to how the material world denied me relief during the Covid-19 pandemic, part due to physical illness, part due to the lack of mobility enacted by long quarantines that were exacerbated due to my status as a European-born US visa holder. When the borders came down around the US, they closed down for me. No exceptions were made for travelers, except those with the “right papers:” US citizens and green card holders only. I was stuck outside my life for about six months. It seems brief now, but in the standstill of time brought about by sweeping public health uncertainty, it felt unending.</p>
<p>Paper gave shape to my life in those constricting times: living in a shoebox apartment in Paris, collecting the last traces of mobile life. Flying out from this country to that and that and that, all over Europe and EuroAsia until a plane finally took off directly to the United States. Finding out that a home is less of a place than a feeling of belonging that the material world cannot reliably secure. I was reunited with my US things in August 2020, and then there was a car crash and my body was never the same. Those things were not my home anymore because my body wasn’t my own either, hadn’t been as soon as it became a hinderance that could not move freely across public spaces, borders, or transportations.</p>

<p>Paper has become in turns treasure and nuisance, waste and duty bound into one. Recycle, reuse, use sparingly, astronomically transactional of a commodity when dealing with relics and antiques, one-of-a-kind autographs, war memorabilia, ephemera of any pre-internet time. A romanticized remedy to the hyper glut of digital information, recommended quaintness at holidays and milestones, when tradition looms larger.</p>

<p>I think of paper every day. It is more fragile than skin but not rarer, for no skin is made the same twice. We can regrow skin but not a beloved piece of paper. It’s the wear that gives it its value. Once worn down or lost, it’s gone for good… not unlike the knowledge that freedom is an embodied construct, dear, rare, and always in danger of ripping away.</p>
