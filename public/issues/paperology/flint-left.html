<h3 class="popout">Paper is <span class="texthighlight">tangled up</span> with how we know ourselves to be human, it composes us even as we compose it.</h3>
<p>I composed this weaving through gathering up the paper debris of my (academic) life over the course of several weeks during the fall of 2021: manuscripts and articles printed and marked up, thank you notes from former students, post-it to do lists and reminders, pieces from delivery boxes, a paper mask, receipts and bills. After gathering them, I cut them into strips and then wove them into a vellum warp. In doing so, I was seeking to create a kind of portrait of a life lived, a momentary snapshot composed of and with paper.</p>

<p>In my inquiries with paper, I am interested in exploring how paper is entangled with other processes and moments and materials. More specifically, I wonder: How might paper offer an entry point to imagining ourselves otherwise as (academic) subjects? As the French philosopher Derrida wrote, “paper has a history that is brief but complex, a technological and material history, a symbolic history of projections and interpretations, a history tangled up with the invention of the human body and of hominization” (1998, 43). Paper is tangled up with how we know ourselves to be human, it composes us even as we compose it. This simultaneous process of composition between paper and us enacts a process of dividuation. Dividuation, distinct from individuation, is a term developed by Deleuze (1992) to describe how control in a capitalist society works to break down life into measures of information.</p>

<p>Paper produces subjects, creating boundaries and categories at the same time as subjects offer and produce paper to make themselves visible. Through this process, we are composed and recomposed through our engagements with paper. Paper comes to stand in for the self, the self is composed with paper. This is repeated and abstracted: the number of journal articles produced comes to stand in for worthiness (to seek employment, tenure, promotion),  or even more abstracted, counting metrics that track citations of those journal articles are used as justification for hiring, promotion, tenure. We do not have a choice whether to be dividuated, (we are counted and marked simply through being academic subjects). However, within this logic is also potential for contagion, potential for uncontainability, incomputation, potential to become otherwise.</p>

<p>Thinking with the concepts of dividuation and contagion, composing this paper weaving with paper debris of my (academic) life was an experimentation in this potential for contagion and possibility with/in paper. Rather than offer up a stable subject, a neatly composed picture of an academic subject, the weaving moves in many, sometimes contradictory directions. The use of vellum as the warp offers both transparency and opacity, you can see through the warp strands, but the text is blurred. The debris used in the composition pushes the boundaries of ‘what counts’ as paper, what matters, gesturing to possibilities beyond. A thank you note, a paper mask, a grocery receipt, layered alongside and woven together with manuscript drafts and vitas and scholarly articles. This weaving, then, asks how might we become uncontainable, contagious. It wonders how thinking with paper and its materiality might enact a decomposition of what counts as (a) paper, what counts as an (academic) subject, and how we count ourselves.</p>
